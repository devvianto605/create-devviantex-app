<h2 id="about">The T3 Stack</h2>

The _"T3 Stack"_ is a web development stack made by [Theo](https://twitter.com/t3dotgg) focused on **simplicity**, **modularity**, and **full-stack typesafety**. It consists of:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org)
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io)
- [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team)
- [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org)

### So... what is `create-t3-app`? A template?

Kind of? `create-t3-app` is a CLI built by seasoned T3 Stack devs to streamline the setup of a modular T3 Stack app. This means each piece is optional, and the "template" is generated based on your specific needs.

After countless projects and many years on this tech, we have lots of opinions and insights. We’ve done our best to encode them into this CLI.

This is **NOT** an all-inclusive template. We **expect** you to bring your own libraries that solve the needs of **YOUR** application. While we don’t want to prescribe solutions to more specific problems like state management and deployment, we [do have some recommendations listed here](https://create.t3.gg/en/other-recs).
